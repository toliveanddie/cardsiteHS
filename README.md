cardsiteHS

in this Hearthstone card site, built with ruby on rails,
you can sign up,
create a profile,
take a look around,
look at hearthstone cards and their meta-data,
and I took it as a personal challenge to implement an arena card selection simulation.
you can see the app working at: https://dry-falls-42780.herokuapp.com/
